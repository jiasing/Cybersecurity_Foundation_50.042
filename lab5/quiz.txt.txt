1.There is no difference between addition and subtraction operation for all elements of GF(3).
--> False. 1+2 = 0 mod 3 while 1 - 2 = 2 mod 3

2.There is no difference between addition and subtraction operation for all elements of GF(2N), for any integer N.
--> True. Because GF(2N) is an extension field where all addition subtraction operations are done using bitwise XOR on the corresponding coefficient.

3.For all elements of GF(2), multiplication is equivalent to an AND gate.
--> True, we can easily see the multiplication table of GF(2) below and see that it is equal to truth table of AND gate.
x	0	1	
0	0	0
1	0	1

4.A polynomial of degree 8 is a possible element of the field GF(2^8).
--> False. In a field of GF(2^8), the highest degree of any polynomial is 7.

5.P(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x + 1 is a irreducible polynomial.
--> False. The polynomial can be factorised into (x+1)(x+1)(x^2 -x + 1). therefore it is not irreducible.
